Identifiers: The alias names(variable names) which we give. Identifiers start with a letter and can be followed by any number
            of letters, digits, or underscores.
            A
            A123
            abc_123_BeX_
** Pig statements work with Relations
  A relation can be defined as follows:
    * A relation is a bag (more specifically, an outer bag).
    * A bag is a collection of tuples.
    * A tuple is an ordered set of fields.
    * A field is a piece of data.
  
  "A Pig relation is a bag of tuples. A Pig relation is similar to a table in a relational database, where the
  tuples in the bag correspond to the rows in a table. Unlike a relational table, however, Pig relations don't 
  require that every tuple contain the same number of fields or that the fields in the same position 
  (column) have the same type."
  
  Relations are referred to by name (or alias). Names are assigned by you as part of the Pig Latin statement. 
  Example: A = LOAD 'student' USING PigStorage(',') AS (name:chararray, age:int, gpa:float);
           DUMP A;
           
           (John,18,4.0F)
           (Mary,19,3.8F)
           (Bill,20,3.9F)
           (Joe,18,3.8F)
           
  Fields are referred to by positional notation or by name (alias).
  postions are refered by $0 (1st item),$1 (2nd Item),$2 (3rd item) etc.
  Example:
  A = LOAD 'student' USING PigStorage(',') AS (name:chararray, age:int, gpa:float);
  X = FOREACH A GENERATE name,$2;
  DUMP X;
  (John,4.0F)
  (Mary,3.8F)
  (Bill,3.9F)
  (Joe,3.8F)
  
** Its a good practice to mention the schema while loading the data:
    ex: A = LOAD 'sales_data' using PigStorage(',') AS (item:charaaray,sale:float);
  
 
Data Types: 
Different data types used: int,long,float,bytearray,double,chararray,boolean,tuple,bag,map(key,value pairs)
  A tuple is an ordered set of fields.
  (suresh,007,suresh@dp.com)  - here each value is called field (unit data) - collection of fields is called tuple
