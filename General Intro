This reference notes doesnt cover the installation part of PIG

** PIG can be executed in two modes (execution modes)-  Local mode & MAp reduce mode.
      IN local Mode - we can access the system local data and test the pig statements scripts before moving/testing into Production.
              /* local mode */
              $pig -x local 
      IN Mapreduce mode - we can access only HDFS files and execute the Pig statemetns/scripts.
              /* mapreduce mode */
              $pig  (or) $ pig -x mapreduce 

** PIG scripts can be executed in BATCH modes & Interactive modes in both execution modes.
** we run PIG scripts in Grunt Shell.
        grunt> A = LOAD 'file name with full path' using PigStorage();
        grunt> DUMP A
** pig scripts have the extension .pig

** Pig Latin statements are generally organized as follows:

      A LOAD statement to read data from the file system.
      A series of "transformation" statements to process the data.
      A DUMP statement to view results or a STORE statement to save the results.
      
** Results can be displayed on any of two ways:
      DUMP keyword to display the results without storing on HDFS
      
      grunt>DUMP A
      
      (suresh,1,100)
      (Gorakala,2,200)
      (PIG,3,300)
      
      STORE keyword to store the results on to HDFS 
      grunt> STORE 

** case sensitive is not adhered for KEYWORDS but is applicable for the identifiers/variables we use
** Function names PigStorage and COUNT are case sensitive.
